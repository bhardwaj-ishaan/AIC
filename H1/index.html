                <p>My name is Ishaan. I am 13 years old and am a rising 9th Grader. I will be going to Mountain House High School. I like coding, drawing, biking, and competing in science competitions.</p>

                <h2>The Tech Me</h2>
                <article id = "tech-des">
                    <p>I have an intermediate level of experience with HTML and CSS. I started self studying in July of lest year, through a full-stack course on Codecademy. I took a break from January to April, as my Science Olympiad stuff was becoming more time-consuming. Other languages I know are a little Python and JS/ReactJS (specifically for game/app design). Something I coded that I am proud of is a recipe app on React. It's pretty simple, with just four screens which have three recipes each, but I am proud that I was able to dedicate time to doing something I love. In this course, I want to learn back-end development.</p>
